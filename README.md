# Installation/usage instructions

Required environment: 
- Online access to PDB database
- Python (version?)
- Biopython (version?)
- xssp (`mkdssp` executable, version?)
- numpy (version?)
- matplotlib (version?)
- pandas (version?)

The environment is also provided as `requirements.txt` file (please provide this file, see https://medium.com/@boscacci/why-and-how-to-make-a-requirements-txt-f329c685181e, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41249401/difference-between-pip-freeze-and-conda-list; `conda list` has the advantage that it also lists non-Python packages, like xssp, which contains the `mkdssp` executable)

After cloning the repo, enter each numbered directory successively (01_..., 02_..., etc.) and execute the Bash driver scripts to reproduce the results.
