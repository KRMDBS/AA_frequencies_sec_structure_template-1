Proteins are made up of smaller building blocks called amino acids, joined together in chains. There are 20 different amino acids. Some
proteins are just a few amino acids long, while others are made up of several thousands. These chains of amino acids fold up in complex
ways, giving each protein a unique 3D shape. The two most common secondary structural elements are alpha helices and beta sheets, though
others occur as well. Amino acids vary in their ability to form the various secondary structure elements.

Goal of this project is to determine the relative frequencies of the constituent amino acids for each protein secondary structural class.

Requirements:
Tools
Libraries
Databases
Tools to download the 
Biopython is needed

Input data:
The input data are pdb-files available in the pdb database: https://www.rcsb.org/search/browse/atc

Required steps to process the data:
It is necessary to obtain a defined or undefined amount of pdb-files of different proteins.
The files have to be parsed to get the relevant information (which amino acids are present in which secondary structure)
These information have to be analyzed and the relevant numbers (content of several amino acids in different secondary structures)
have to be calculated. The results of the calculations have to be output to a human-readable file format and visualized as bar charts,
where the different amino acids are shown connected to the secondary structural elements alpha helices, beta sheets and "irregular" 
for any amino acid not within a helix or sheet.

- Milestone 1: Collect necessary information
	WP 1: Learn about PDB database -> 1 hour
		The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a database for the three-dimensional structural data of large biological molecules, such as
		proteins and nucleic acids. The data, typically obtained by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, or cryoelectron 
		microscopy, and submitted by biologists and biochemists from around the world, are freely accessible on the Internet via the
		websites of its member organisations. The PDB is overseen by an organisation called the Worldwide Protein Data Bank, wwPDB.
		The PDB database is updated weekly, along with its holdings list. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank)
	WP 2: Learn about pdb file format -> 3 hours
		The file format initially used by the PDB was called PDB file format.
	WP 3: ... -> 2 hours

- Milestone 2: Select and download the protein structure files from PDB
	-> Deliverale(s): Folder with PDB files
	-> Required Python scripts:
		-Python script 1, "do something
			input =
			output =
			-> x hours
		-Python script 2, "fdgghetg
			input =
			output = 
			-> x hours
		-Python script 3, "fgdfköghg
			input =
			output =
			-> x hours
- Milestone 3: Parse the PDB files and calculate the frequency of amino acids in each secondary structure
	-> Deliverable(s): File with calcuated results
	-> Required Python scripts:
		-Python script 4, "dfgöghg
			input =
			output =
			-> x hours
- Milestone 4: Visualize the results of the calculation
	-> Deliverable(s): File with visualization chart
